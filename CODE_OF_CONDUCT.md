# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Covenant
version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to [security@go-zh-fhir.dev](mailto:security@go-zh-fhir.dev).

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
abusive, or harassing.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public when an
individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project include using an official project e-mail address, posting
via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative
at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further
defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [security@go-zh-fhir.dev](mailto:security@go-zh-fhir.dev).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team
is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.
