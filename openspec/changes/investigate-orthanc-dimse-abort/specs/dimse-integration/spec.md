- **AND** operation completes without timeout errors
- **AND** final C-MOVE-RSP with success status (0x0000) indicates completion

#### Scenario: SCP receives C-STORE from Orthanc

- **WHEN** SCP server listens for incoming associations from Orthanc
- **AND** DICOM instance is sent to Orthanc via REST API triggering C-STORE forward
- **THEN** SCP accepts association from Orthanc
- **AND** SCP receives C-STORE-RQ with DICOM instance
- **AND** SCP successfully decodes received dataset
- **AND** SCP sends C-STORE-RSP with success status (0x0000)
- **AND** operation completes without timeout errors

### Requirement: Transfer Syntax Negotiation Compliance

The DIMSE implementation SHALL correctly negotiate and apply transfer syntaxes according to DICOM Part 7
specification.

#### Scenario: Implicit VR Little Endian transfer syntax

- **WHEN** presentation context negotiates Implicit VR Little Endian (1.2.840.10008.1.2)
- **THEN** dataset SHALL be encoded using Implicit VR format
- **AND** all data elements use 4-byte length fields
- **AND** byte order is little-endian
- **AND** VR is not present in encoded stream

#### Scenario: Explicit VR Little Endian transfer syntax

- **WHEN** presentation context negotiates Explicit VR Little Endian (1.2.840.10008.1.2.1)
- **THEN** dataset SHALL be encoded using Explicit VR format
- **AND** data elements include 2-byte VR field
- **AND** length field is 2 bytes for short VRs, 4 bytes for long VRs
- **AND** byte order is little-endian

#### Scenario: Transfer syntax mismatch detection

- **WHEN** negotiated transfer syntax differs from dataset encoding
- **THEN** PACS server SHALL reject operation with Abort PDU or error status
- **AND** go-zh-fhir SHALL detect and report the rejection
- **AND** error message SHALL indicate transfer syntax mismatch

### Requirement: PDU Structure Compliance

The DIMSE implementation SHALL encode and decode PDUs according to DICOM Part 8 specification.

#### Scenario: A-ASSOCIATE-RQ structure is valid

- **WHEN** SCU initiates association
- **THEN** A-ASSOCIATE-RQ SHALL contain valid Application Context Name
- **AND** Presentation Contexts SHALL have odd-numbered IDs
- **AND** Each Presentation Context SHALL have Abstract Syntax UID
- **AND** Each Presentation Context SHALL have one or more Transfer Syntax UIDs
- **AND** Maximum PDU Length SHALL be specified
- **AND** Implementation Class UID SHALL be present

#### Scenario: P-DATA-TF fragmentation is correct

- **WHEN** DIMSE message exceeds maximum PDU length
- **THEN** message SHALL be fragmented into multiple P-DATA-TF PDUs
- **AND** each fragment SHALL have correct Message Control Header
- **AND** command fragments SHALL be marked with 0x01
- **AND** dataset fragments SHALL be marked with 0x00 or 0x02 (last)
- **AND** final fragment SHALL have last fragment bit set

#### Scenario: Command set encoding is Implicit VR

- **WHEN** DIMSE command set is encoded
- **THEN** command set SHALL use Implicit VR Little Endian encoding
- **AND** command set SHALL NOT use Explicit VR regardless of dataset transfer syntax
- **AND** all DIMSE command attributes SHALL be present and valid

### Requirement: Error Recovery and Diagnostics

The DIMSE implementation SHALL provide clear diagnostics when protocol errors occur during Orthanc integration.

#### Scenario: Abort PDU received from Orthanc

- **WHEN** Orthanc sends A-ABORT PDU
- **THEN** go-zh-fhir SHALL capture abort reason and source
- **AND** error message SHALL include abort reason code
- **AND** error message SHALL include abort source (UL service-user or service-provider)
- **AND** operation SHALL fail gracefully without panic

#### Scenario: I/O timeout during DIMSE operation

- **WHEN** expected PDU is not received within timeout period
- **THEN** operation SHALL fail with timeout error
- **AND** error message SHALL indicate which PDU was expected
